	There are four questions in the project. All the required answers are in the microsoft files. However, the results from the testing are in the TestResult folder. Q1 through Q3, reader can just open it to get the reference. On question 4, we need to do multiple tests with different flags. What kind of arguments given for test of question 4 are located in the Question4TestTrials.txt. It tells what argument is given for any trial in the fourth question. In addition, there is an argument that we could use to put the result into a separate file. Those are text file format. However, if reader opens it directly, the format will not line up correctly. User can use notepad++ or terminal to open it.
